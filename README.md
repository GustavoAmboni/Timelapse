# Timelapse

Timelapse is a simple time-tracker console application that helps you keep track of the time spent on the recording items.

## How it works?

By using commands, you can track, stop and list items that you inform.
Any command used in the first run, will trigger the console application to create a folder in the `%appdata%` path of your system called **Timelapse**. This folder contains the database necessary to save the information required to track the the items.
This includes the name of the items, description, periods that the items has been run and stopped, etc. As this application runs in separeted commands, the database is necessary to keep the information to track.
